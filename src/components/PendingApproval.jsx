          approved you can not create your products and gigs. Please wait while
          your account is approved by admin. While your account is pending
          approval, you may not be able to create new products or gigs until an
          administrator reviews and approves your account. This waiting period
          can vary depending on the platform's policies and the workload of the
          administrators. During this time, it's a good idea to review the
          platform's terms of service and guidelines to ensure your offerings
          comply with their rules. Additionally, you might consider reaching out
          to the platform's support team if you have any questions or concerns
          about the approval process or the status of your account. Once your
          account is approved, you should be able to proceed with creating
          products or gigs and engaging with the platform's community.
